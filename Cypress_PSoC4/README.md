MCUmisfits: Cypress PSoC4
=========================

I originally wrote this in 2015 and only recently unearthed the source code.

What is missing from this to make it much more complete would be include files to provide all the register definitions.  The registers are defined in the following PDFs:

[PSoC 4000 Family: PSoC® 4 Registers Technical Reference Manual](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/technical-reference-manuals/psoc-4000-family-psoc-4-registers-technical-reference)

[PSoC 4000S Family: PSoC® 4 Registers Technical Reference Manual](http://www.cypress.com/documentation/technical-reference-manuals/psoc-4000s-family-psocr-4-registers-technical-reference)

[PSoC 4100/4200 Family PSoC® 4 Registers TRM](
http://www.cypress.com/documentation/technical-reference-manuals/psoc-41004200-family-psoc-4-registers-trm-technical)

However, I don't have a reliable method to "scrape" this data into a machine parse-able format.
