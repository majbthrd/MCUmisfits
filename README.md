==========

This is a collection of unofficial support packages for microcontrollers that are not already supported by Rowley Crossworks for ARM.

[Cypress PSoC4](./Cypress_PSoC4/README.md)

[Synwit SWM](./Synwit_SWM/README.md)

Most users will likely just want to download the .hzq files from the Releases tab.  However, the source code is also provided.

Installing a package manually in Rowley Crossworks for ARM is straightforward: Choose Tools -> Packages -> Manually Install Packages.. from the pull-down menus, and pick your .hzq file of choice.
